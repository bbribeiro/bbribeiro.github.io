About me
======
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/), University of British Columbia. I work on topics in Development and Urban Economics. My research examines how public policies affect economic opportunities for low-income families and shape the accessibility of cities worldwide.
