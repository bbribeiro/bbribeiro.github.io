I am a PhD candidate at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/) of the University of British Columbia (UBC). I work on topics in Development and Urban Economics. My research examines how public policies affect economic opportunities for low-income families and shape the accessibility of cities worldwide.

I am also a collaborator at [Cities in Motion Lab](https://citiesinmotionlab.org/), a research lab that helps cities worldwide compare their transportation and accessibility performance with peer cities and improve policy based on best practices. Before joining UBC, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Development Research Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/research) of the World Bank. I have a Master's and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from [PUC-Rio](https://www.econ.puc-rio.br/en).
